# Session Progress — Nocturne Admin Redesign

Branch: `feat/nocturne-redesign`
Spec: `docs/design/specs/2026-09-09-nocturne-admin-redesign-design.md`
Handoff: `reference/design_handoff_dsforms_admin/`

## Phases

| Phase | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Vendored assets (Inter, Phosphor), Nocturne tokens, `base.html` shell | **done** |
| 1 | `spam.Detail`/`Signal`/`DefaultThreshold`, `config.SpamThreshold`, schema, store methods | **done** |
| 2 | Submit-handler rewiring (allow → block → honeypot → score → hold) | not started |
| 3 | Forms, form detail, reader drawer | **done** |
| 4 | Quarantine + breakdown, Filter rules | **done** |
| 5 | Home aggregates, inline-SVG charts, rate-limit snapshot | **done** |
| 6 | Form settings, Waitlists, Users, Backups, Login, empty states | **done** |
| 7 | FTS5 search (⌘K), digest email, false-positive reporting | **done** |
| 8 | Landing page (`docs/index.html`) | **done** |

## Done since

- **Module path** `github.com/youruser/dsforms` → `github.com/barancezayirli/dsforms`.
  The `go mod init` placeholder from commit `fcb19d1` never matched the repo URL, which
  made `go get github.com/barancezayirli/dsforms` fail outright. It is one isolated
  commit on this branch, so it still reviews and reverts independently.

## Deferred items

| Item | Why deferred | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` for the landing page's Admin UI section | The admin section currently describes the four screens in cards rather than showing them. Real screenshots need a populated instance and a decision about what data to show publicly. | A follow-up PR |

## Open questions

_None currently — D1–D10 in the spec settle the handoff's open items._
